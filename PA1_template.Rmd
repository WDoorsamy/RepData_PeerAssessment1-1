## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
    dir.create("./data")
}
fileUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = "./data/activity.zip")
unzip("./data/activity.zip", exdir = "./data", overwrite = TRUE)
act1 <- read.csv("./data/activity.csv", sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
aggrstep <- aggregate(act$steps, list(act$date), sum)
names(aggrstep) <- c("date", "totsteps")
```
What is the average daily activity pattern?
Make histogram for total steps for each day:
```{r}
hist(aggrstep$totsteps, main = "Frequency for total number of steps taken each day", 
    xlab = "total step")
```




## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
